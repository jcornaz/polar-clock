# A simple polar clock with RUST, WASM and YEW

![Build](https://github.com/jcornaz/polar-clock/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

This is a web "polar clock". A kind of clock I find especially satisfactory to watch on new-year's eve.

It is published here: https://jcornaz.github.io/polar-clock/

I made this project in order to experiment with [rust], [web-assembly] and [yew].

[web-assembly]: https://webassembly.org
[yew]: https://yew.rs


## Status

This was a one-shot toy project that I will not maintain.

The project is available to anyone interested by studying, modifing or using it. However, be aware that it isn't well tested.
